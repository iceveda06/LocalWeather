# LocalWeather

Check out my demo:  http://iceveda06.github.io/LocalWeather/

NOTE:  Since OpenWeatherMap API is through http, chrome won't load it unless you enable 'unsafe script loading' to allow pulling data over http from OpenWeatherMap API.  If you are on Chrome, you should see an icon show up next to your favorite (star) icon.  Click on it and allow 'unsafe script loading'

Current Features:  
  -  Toggle between Fahrenheit and Celcius
  -  Background picture according to the temperature
